All bat files in this folder go into the server root, or game root!
Make sure to have a pluto.exe in that root as well
make sure to edit "dead_ops_server.bat" and add your server key!

Open the localappdata folder, and use the Install_ServerConfigs.bat to install config files for dead ops

Run the "DEAD_OPS_PLUTO_FIX.bat" after each pulto update!
