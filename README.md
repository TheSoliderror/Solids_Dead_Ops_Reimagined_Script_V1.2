# Solids_Dead_Ops_Reimagined_Script_V1.2
This combines my First Person Scrip With Other Code To Create A New Dead Ops Experience. (This is a beta script to get me ready for making this into a mod with custom textures &amp; weapons) 

# Files
* This repo contains files I personly used for my game during testing, both for solo/private match, and server.

# Solo
* Use the scripts intaller and then play and enjoy

# Private Match & Server
* Use the scripts insatller
* Open the server files, and then use the Dead_Ops_Pluto_Fix.bat (make sure to run this fix after having the launcher open if for private match)
* Private Match players can now play. 
* Server Hosters, add server batch files to server/game files, edit launcher bat files to add server key
* Move Server Configs, edit as needed.
* Make sure there is not any custom zombie scrips in your zom scripts folder, as this conflicks with the map!
* Run your server, hope it works, if not, idk dm or figure it out. Its a beta.
